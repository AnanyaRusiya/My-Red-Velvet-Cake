This is everyone's Favouriteand a delicious Red Velvet Cake Recipe.I think Red 

Velvet Cake is the queen of all layer cakes.It is Dramatic, amd completely 

covered with silky cream cheesefrosting.It is Sweet marriage Buttermilk and 

vanilla with  a little cocaofor good measure.Red velvet cake is much more than 

vanilla cake tinted red. This recipe produces the best red velvet cake with 

superior buttery, vanilla, and cocoa flavors, as well as a delicious tang from 

buttermilk. My trick is to whip the egg whites, which guarantees a smooth velvet

 crumb. This is my best recipe.And I hope Many of you like this too.
